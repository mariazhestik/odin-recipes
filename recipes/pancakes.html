    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Crowd-pleasing banana pancakes made from scratch that are ready in minutes.<br>
        A fun twist on ordinary pancakes.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Flour</li>
        <li>Sugar</li>
        <li>Baking powder</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>An Egg</li>
        <li>Milk</li>
        <li>Vegetable oil</li>
        <li>Bananas</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine your dry ingredients (flour, sugar, salt, baking powder) in one bowl and<br>
             your wet ingredients (egg, milk, vegetable oil, mashed bananas) in another<br>
             bowl. </li>
        <li>Add the dry ingredients to the bowl with the wet ingredients, then stir until<br>
            they're incorporated. It's OK if your batter is slightly lumpy.</li>
        <li>Pour the batter in Â¼ cup portions onto a lightly oiled pan or griddle over<br>
            medium-high heat.</li>
        <li>Cook for a few minutes, flip with a spatula, and cook for another few minutes<br>
            (or until each side is golden brown).</li>
        <li>Serve your banana pancakes immediately. They're delicious alone or with your<br>
            favorite pancake toppings.</li>
    </ol>
